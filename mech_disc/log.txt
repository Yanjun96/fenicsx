contact is 0% in step2
maybe because of deformation has problem, check again

1: maybe thermal deformation is incorrect, without variation_initial, check deformation of brake_pad_1

Temperature difference is incorrect. Need to conact tutorial author.

has been implemented to brake 2, but still not working, need to print some details one by one.

Coordinate has been revised. Previously, it has issue. The main problem is for brake pad, when got contact nodes, it coordinates are fixed. After get contact nodes, rotation again can address this issue, rotation anger is i*angular_r since every time, it start from original place.

before solver, u_old and u_new value is the same?
but for next step, the u is different. need to solve, otherwise, cannot get Delta_T.
